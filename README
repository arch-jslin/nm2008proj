This is a little project that we are preparing for the nightmarket 2008 gathering.
For the information regarding nightmarket 2008, please visit http://www.nightmarket.org

This project is a little game about the Losheng Sanatorium, and about what is happening 
to this region including the people still living in the Sanatorium. We are trying to
use this game as a medium to draw the public attention in a fun and interactive way,
and make people (who still don't know the incident in the Losheng Sanatorium) to 
reflect on themselves, "Are we (the public) doing the right thing to them?"

Please check out this article on the wikipedia to learn more about the topic:

Technical Issue -
  This project runs on Flash 9 (written in ActionScript 3)
  What we will be using in this little game is:
    * Papervision3D svn                               - http://blog.papervision3d.org
    * TweenMax                                        - http://www.TweenMax.com
    * WiiFlash svn (and of course wiimote & nunchunk) - http://www.wiiflash.org
    
  This is a very small game and will be finished in a few days, but nevertheless
  it'll make some use of these great as3 libraries. Many thanks to these extremely 
  brilliant and generous people who implemented all the open source libraries.
  
Best regards,
